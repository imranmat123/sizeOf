Exercise 4.1 on the Udemy course is a C++ programming exercise called "sizeOf", that demonstrates how to use the sizeof operator to determine the size of different data types. The program starts by printing a header and then lists the sizes of various data types such as char, int, short, long, and long long. The program also lists the sizes of floating-point data types such as float, double, and long double.

The program then demonstrates how to use the <climits> library to print the minimum and maximum values of different data types. The program lists the minimum and maximum values of char, int, short, long, and long long.

Finally, the program shows how to use the sizeof operator with variable names to determine the size of variables such as age and wage, which are declared as integers and doubles, respectively.

This exercise is useful for beginners who want to learn about the different data types in C++ and how to use the sizeof operator to determine their size. It also demonstrates how to use the <climits> library to print the minimum and maximum values of different data types.
